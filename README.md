# cmake "hello, world"

CMake itself is not build tool but build system generation tool: it reads
project building description and generates required files for specified
buildsystem (GNU Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio solution file, etc).
Official tutorial can be found
[here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).

This project is not CMake tutorial but rather walk-through for using it from
* [command line](cli.md)
* [Visual Studio](msvc.md)
* [build pipeline](pipeline.md)
